SBMLCartographer: Metabolic Flux Analysis Carbon-13 Transition Mapping
=========================================================
SBMLCartographer is a python package which utilises SBML API's to track the transition
of Carbon-13 atoms between biomass reactions in order to analysis metabolic flux (typically in Yeast).
This was started as a MSc level thesis project, but is being re-written and distributed as a package.
It is in very early stages and has no functionality as of present. Constant work in progress.

What's New
==========
Pre-release status.

No Functionality yet.


Installation Prerequisites
==========================

Work in progress. Hopefully minimal requisites outside of SBML API's


Usage
=====

Here's how to use it for now. To launch the program when installed, launch via terminal:

    $ sbmlc -flags

All flags for the application are:

    -flag1 :: haha what will go here?
	-flag2 :: who knows
